# [Golf Pads](https://golfpads.page.link/appstore)

Golf pads is a hyper-casual game that I developed in a constrained 3 month period, using Unity (C#) as the core platform. I host the application on the Google Play Store where it is currently available to download for free.  In order to commercialise the app, I added in-app purchases and multiple types of advertisements, including interstitial and banner ads. Since the game’s launch, I have been regularly updating the app to fix bugs and add new features. In a recent update, I added a leaderboard for users to compete with their friends and to see each other’s scores. You can also customise the appearance of the game by using credits earned in the game, at the in-game shop.
